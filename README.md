**Hey, I'm Daniel 👋**

I'm a Software Engineer from [Kiel](https://www.kiel.de)/Germany 🇩🇪 in love with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Node](https://nodejs.org). I created [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io) (formerly: Javaslang), a popular Java library for object-functional programming.

Beside coding 👨‍💻, I'm passionate about my beautiful wife 👰 and our five children 🧒. I love biking 🚴‍♀️, the next beach 🏄‍♂️ is only half an hour away. My favorite drink is a good coffee ☕️. Staying fit & in shape is mostly a matter of good nutrition 🥑.

Join me, I'm only one [tweet](https://twitter.com/danieldietrich) away!

Life is great :) ☀️
